# Permission.DocumentAuthor Property (Office)

Gets or sets the name in e-mail form of the author of the active document. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **DocumentAuthor**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Permission** object.


## Remarks

The  **DocumentAuthor** property returns or sets the author of the active document. The author always has non-expiring owner rights to the document, whether owner permission is granted explicitly (through a **[UserPermission](24378204-2fdd-47ba-2080-fbc409955325.md)** object) or not.

The  **DocumentAuthor** property can only be changed to a different account that has been certified through the permissions user interface to open restricted content on the local computer. In most cases, users who have a single Windows account can only choose between their Windows and their Passport identities.

If the user's Microsoft Windows and Passport identities use the same e-mail address, then use the format  `passport:someone@example.com` to specify the Passport identity as the **DocumentAuthor** property.


## Example

The following example displays information about the permissions settings of the active document, including the document author.


```vb
 Dim irmPermission As Office.Permission 
 Dim strIRMInfo As String 
 Set irmPermission = ActiveWorkbook.Permission 
 If irmPermission.Enabled Then 
 strIRMInfo = "Permissions are enabled on this document." &; vbCrLf 
 strIRMInfo = strIRMInfo &; " View in trusted browser: " &; _ 
 irmPermission.EnableTrustedBrowser &; vbCrLf &; _ 
 " Document author: " &; irmPermission.DocumentAuthor &; vbCrLf &; _ 
 " Users with rights: " &; irmPermission.Count &; vbCrLf &; _ 
 " Cache licenses locally: " &; irmPermission.StoreLicenses &; vbCrLf &; _ 
 " Request permission URL: " &; irmPermission.RequestPermissionURL &; vbCrLf 
 If irmPermission.PermissionFromPolicy Then 
 strIRMInfo = strIRMInfo &; " Permissions applied from policy:" &; vbCrLf &; _ 
 " Policy name: " &; irmPermission.PolicyName &; vbCrLf &; _ 
 " Policy description: " &; irmPermission.PolicyDescription 
 Else 
 strIRMInfo = strIRMInfo &; " Default permissions applied." 
 End If 
 Else 
 strIRMInfo = "Permissions are NOT enabled on this document." 
 End If 
 MsgBox strIRMInfo, vbInformation + vbOKOnly, "IRM Information" 
 Set irmPermission = Nothing 

```
