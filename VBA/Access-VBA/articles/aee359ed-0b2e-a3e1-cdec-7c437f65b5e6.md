# Cannot make a new replica because the <name> object in <name> container could not be made replicable. (Error 3582)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The database could not be made replicable because the specified object could not be replicated. For example, if the maximum number of allowed indexes is exceeded on a table, the table cannot be replicated. To prevent this error, prior to making the database replicable ensure that the objects in the database adhere to replication requirements.
