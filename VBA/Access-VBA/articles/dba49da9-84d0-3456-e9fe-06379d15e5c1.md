# You cannot change the data master attribute for the replica set. It allows data changes only at the Design Master. (Error 3594)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Whether a replicated database allows users to change data only at the Design Master or at all replicas is determined when the database is first converted into a Design Master. After the database has been converted, the single or multiple data master attribute cannot be changed.
