# ODBC - call failed. (Error 3146)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Using an ODBC connection, you tried to perform an operation on data in an ODBC data source. This error may occur when the ODBC data source is on a network drive and you are not connected to the network. Make sure the network is available, and then try the operation again.
