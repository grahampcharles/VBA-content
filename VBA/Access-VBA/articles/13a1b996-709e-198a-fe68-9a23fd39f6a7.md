# JOIN operation <operation> refers to a field that is not in one of the joined tables. (Error 3082)

You tried to execute an SQL statement that contains an invalid join. This error occurs when you try to create a join on a field that is not in one of the joined tables. The following example produces this error.




```sql
SELECT Authors.FirstName, Titles.ISBN 
FROM Authors, Titles, AuthorTitles, 
Authors INNER JOIN Titles ON Authors.ID = AuthorTitles.ISBN;
```

The error occurs because the join involves the Authors and Titles tables, but the joined fields are in the Authors and AuthorTitles tables.
