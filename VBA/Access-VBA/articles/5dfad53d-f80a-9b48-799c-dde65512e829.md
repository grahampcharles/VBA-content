# The KeepLocal property cannot be set on a database; it can be set only on the objects in a database. (Error 3458)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The  **KeepLocal** property is set to "T" for objects in a database that you do not want replicated. You cannot set this property for the entire database.
