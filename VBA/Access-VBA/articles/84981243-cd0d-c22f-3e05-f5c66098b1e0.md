# Synchronizer <name> is also using the same File System dropbox <name> (Error 3630)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

Each Synchronizer should have a unique file system dropbox. Using the same dropbox location for multiple Synchronizers can result in lost messages and incomplete exchanges. The applicatin is unable to create the signal file because it is already opened by another transporter.
