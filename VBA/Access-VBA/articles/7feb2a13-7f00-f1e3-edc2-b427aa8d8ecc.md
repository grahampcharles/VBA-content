# Could not lock file. (Error 3050)

 **Last modified:** December 30, 2015

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The operating system will not allow the Microsoft Access database engine to create a lock file (.LDB) in the same directory where the database file resides. You need to have write privileges to the directory that contains the database you are trying to open. This error can also occur if you are trying to use the passive shut down/connection control feature while the database is opened exclusively.
